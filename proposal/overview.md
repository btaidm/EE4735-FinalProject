Overview
========

The overall goal of this project is to create a robot that will follow the first
object it sees that is at least 6 ft in diameter. It is a combination of the
the Ultrasonic Radar Towers and the Navi bot project. It will use at least 2 Ultrasonic
sensors for tracking the object and the robot base for movement. However, unlike the
Radar Towers, floating point operations will be allowed where need, but there will be a
bias against them.
