## Put this Makefile in your project directory---i.e., the directory
## containing the paper you are writing. Assuming you are using the
## rest of the toolchain here, you can use it to create .html, .tex,
## and .pdf output files (complete with bibliography, if present) from
## your markdown file.
## -	Change the paths at the top of the file as needed.
## -	Using `make` without arguments will generate html, tex, and pdf
## 	output files from all of the files with the designated markdown
##	extension. The default is `.md` but you can change this.
## -	You can specify an output format with `make tex`, `make pdf` or
## - 	`make html`.
## -	Doing `make clean` will remove all the .tex, .html, and .pdf files
## 	in your working directory. Make sure you do not have files in these
##	formats that you want to keep!
